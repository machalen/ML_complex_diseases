### Running The Code

All the Python scripts are located in the 'Python_scripts' folder and are organized into subdirectories named according to the ML and DL methods used:

  * [Logistic Regression (LR)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html)
  * [Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees (GB)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier.html)

  * [Feedforward neural network (FFN)](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html)
  * [Convolutional neural networks (CNN)](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html)

The strategy employed is nested cross-validation (nested CV), which is an adaptation of the K-fold CV that consists in setting one outer loop and one inner loop of CV. In this approach, the CV in the inner loop is performed on the training set of the outer loop and is used to select the optimum hyperparameter configuration. This step is implemented in the scripts named __*1_XX_With_nestedCV.py*__.

Conversely, the CV in the outer loop is used to train the final model with the selected hyperparameter configuration obtained from the inner loop, and to test the model with the remaining test set that has not been used for hyperparameter selection or training the model. This step is implemented in the scripts named __*2_XX_FinalModel.py*__.

Iterating over different folds in the inner and outer loop allows for the use of different samples in training, validation, and testing in each iteration, optimizing the use of all the available samples. At the end, nested CV generate as many final models as number of folds in the outer loop.

--------------------------------------------------------

#### Hyperparameter selection in the inner loop of the nested CV

\
The grid search approach is employed for hyperparameter selection, which involves listing a set of values for each hyperparameter, and testing all possible combinations. The set of hyperparameters is listed in the __*parameters.txt*__ file located in the __Hyperparameters__ directory and is divided into subsections corresponding to each ML method. The __*parameters.txt*__ file can be modified to include the [values](Hyperparameters/README.md) to test in the grid search.

The first step is to run the inner loop of the nested CV (10-fold CV) for hyperparameter serlection. This step is run 5 times, one for each fold in the outer loop ($manualFold parameter in the code from 0 to 4). The example below is to run LR, but the same input parameters apply to all methods except for CNN.

```bash
#Input numeric matrix in .txt format where columns are predictors and rows are samples.
inMtrx=/FullPath/Mtrx.txt
#Labels corresponding to the sample IDs in the input matrix in .txt format. The first column named eid contains sample IDs and the second column named cond contains binary categories: control or disease condition.
inLab=/FullPath/labels.txt 
#Full path to the results directory.
outDir=/FullPath/ToResults/Name
#Name of the disease condition in inputLabels.
PatCond=MS
#Fold from the outer loop of the nested cross-validation used in the job (0 to 4).
manualFold=0

#Run the code for LR
python ./Python_scripts/LR/1_LR_With_nestedCV.py -m "$inMtrx" -l "$inLab" -o "$outDir" -c "$PatCond" -f "$manualFold"
```
\
For the CNN, the command is as follows:

```bash
#Input numeric matrix in .txt format where columns are predictors and rows are samples.
inMtrx=/FullPath/Mtrx.txt
#Labels corresponding to the sample IDs in the input matrix in .txt format. The first column named eid contains sample IDs and the second column named cond contains binary categories: control or disease condition.
inLab=/FullPath/labels.txt 
#Matrix with first column containing predictor IDs named snvIDs and the second column containing chromosome numbers. The columns are tab-separated.
conv_chr=FullPath/chr_mtrx.txt
#Matrix with first column containing sample IDs named snvIDs and the second column containing genomic position in bp. The columns are tab-separated.
conv_pos=FullPath/pos_mtrx.txt
#Full path to the results directory.
outDir=/FullPath/ToResults/Name
#Name of the disease condition in inputLabels.
PatCond=MS
#Fold from the outer loop of the nested cross-validation used in the job (0 to 4).
manualFold=0

#Run the code for CNN
python ./Python_scripts/CNN/1_CNN_With_nestedCV.py -m "$inMtrx" -l "$inLab" -a "$conv_chr" -p "$conv_pos" -o "$outDir" -c "$PatCond" -f "$manualFold"
```
\
This code will generate a file named _'Name_MS_fold0_LR_EvMetrics_CV.txt'_ for LR and _'Name_MS_fold0_CNN_EvMetrics_CV.txt'_ for CNN. Each row in the file corresponds to a different hyperparameter configuration, and each column represents the mean and standard deviation of different evaluation metrics obtained on the training and test sets. The column containing the hyperparameter configurations lists the hyperparameters separated by vertical bars in the same order as in the __*parameters.txt*__ file.

The column _'TotalRank'_ corresponds to the value of balanced accuracy minus the absolute difference between specificity and sensitivity. This metric is used to rank hyperparamaters from the highest (better performance) to the lowest scores (worse performance). However, the best hyperparameter configuration can be selected based on different criteria. 
\

--------------------------------------------------------

#### Final models from the outer loop of the nested CV

\
For each fold in the outer loop of the nested CV (5-fold CV), the hyperparameter configuration selected in the inner loop is applied in the outer loop. This process is repeated 5 times, once for each fold ($manualFold parameter in the code from 0 to 4), resulting in 5 different final models.
